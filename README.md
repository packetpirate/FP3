### Team Members
<i>Darin Beaudreau</i> - [packetpirate](http://www.github.com/packetpirate)

<i>Xiaoyang Li</i> - [XiaoyangLi1988](http://www.github.com/XiaoyangLi1988)

### A Team Name
<i>Le Midnight Wannabes</i>

### Project Title
<i>Tune Traveler</i>

### Project Concept
We will implement the A* pathfinding algorithm to solve mazes or simply find the shortest path from A to B.
The difference is that we will assign random musical notes to each "tile" in the grid, and those notes will be played
if the "player" moves over them. So as the algorithm walks over the path it creates, a small song will be created.

<b>WARNING: Randomly generated songs may sound like garbage.</b>

### Libraries You Plan to Use 
SGL (OpenGL), Portaudio
